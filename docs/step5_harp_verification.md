### Step 5: Run a HARP point verification for the runs
Currently, the only verification/validation software included in OSVAS is based in HARP and uses HARP verification scripts. HARP verifications are configured also with a HARP yaml file. In this step, the harp configuration template in $OSVAS/config_files/HARP/OSVAS_HARP_verif.yml is used to generate a configuration file for the verification. The template is modified to include a list of Expnames, paths to the observations for the station, verification period read from Validation_data.validation_start and Validation_data.validation_end, output paths. Currently this step only calls for the verification of H and LE, but can be easily extended to other variables.
