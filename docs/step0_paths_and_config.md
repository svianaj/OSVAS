### Step 0: Define Station and relevant paths, read which steps to run from the yaml file
- Make sure that you have the yaml file in the correct location (yaml_file="$OSVAS/config_files/Stations/${STATION_NAME}.yml")
- Read the yaml configuration file, find out which OSVAS & SURFEX steps to need to be run, and the names of the experiments assigned to each namelist to test
- Make sure that you have the namelist file in the correct location (yaml_file="$OSVAS/namelists/Stations/{STATION_NAME}/OPTIONS.nam_{EXPNAME}")
